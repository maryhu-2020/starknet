	- **RECEIVED**: The transaction was received by the sequencer.
	- **PENDING**: The transaction passed the validation and entered the pending block.
	- **REJECTED**: The transaction failed validation and thus was skipped.
	- **ACCEPTED_ON_L2**: The transaction passed the validation and entered an actual created block.
